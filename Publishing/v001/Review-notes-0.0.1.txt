# Feature summary

- Broadcaster can configure a number of bingo entries, meant to represent funny occurences that happen regularly on his Stream
- These entries will be presented (randomized) on a configurable Bingo grid, to each participating Viewer
- Viewers must report the funny occurences as they occur
- Moderators and the broadcaster must then confirm the occurence
- Viewers must pay extra attention to the stream to complete their grid
- An EBS is used to keep track of the game and send notifications to moderators and viewers

# Testing walkthrough

1- Configure the Bingo entries & grid
  1.1 - Populate entries
    1.1.a - By clicking the import button. Select a text file, one line per entry.
    1.1.b - By clicking the + button, type-in the entry text.
  1.2 - Select entries for the next game
    - Click the + button next to the entries you want to select for the next game.
  1.3 - Configure the Bingo grid
    - Configure the number of rows & columns you want for the game
    - Number of cells in the grid need to be lesser or equal to the number selected entries
  1.4 - Save the configuration
    - Click Save
  1.5 - Launch the game
    - Click Start game
  
2- Play as a viewer
  - On the stream, unfold the grid by clicking the widget on the top-left corner
  - Click one of the cell and confirm your observation with the tick button
  - Observe that a countdown is now ticking, waiting for a moderator confirmation

3- Confirm as a moderator
  - On the stream, as a moderator, observe the moderation pane open when a viewer makes a tentative
  - If needed, click the moderation widget below the grid widget to unfold the moderation pane
  - Pending confirmations are displayed on top, with their countdown ticking
  - All the other entries are available for confirmation below, if viewers haven't spotted them yet

4- See the result
  - On the viewer's overlay, observe the cell either turn green or red, depending whether a moderator confirmed it
  - On the chat, if a viewer has completed a row, a column, or the full grid, a celebration will be sent from the EBS. (Note: I expect this feature will only be active once published)
  - Viewers are expected to celebrate on the chat on their own initiative as well, of course
