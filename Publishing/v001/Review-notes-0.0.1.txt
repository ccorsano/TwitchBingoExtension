# Description

First release !
Please consider this as a minimum viable version of this extension, and check regularly for updates.
Note: This extension is dependent on an extension service, which for this initial release is not scaled for a large viewing audience.

Customizable & interactive bingo games for streamers communities:
- Have yourself or your moderation team come up with stream events viewers should pay attention to.
- Let viewers spot and report the events as they appear on your stream
- Moderators as well as yourself can confirm or reject reported events
- When an event is reported, moderators have 2 minutes (configurable) to confirm it actually happened
- After the event is confirmed, viewers have a the same configurable grace period to report it

The extension will celebrate the most attentive viewers by posting messages on the chat.

# Feature summary

- Broadcaster can configure a number of bingo entries, meant to represent funny occurrences that happen regularly on his Stream
- These entries will be presented (randomized) on a configurable Bingo grid, to each participating Viewer
- Viewers must report the funny occurrences as they occur
- Moderators and the broadcaster must then confirm the occurrence
- Viewers must pay extra attention to the stream to complete their grid
- An EBS is used to keep track of the game and send notifications to moderators and viewers
- A Live Configuration view is provided for convenience, and mirror the features of the static Configuration page.

# Testing walkthrough

1- Configure the Bingo entries & grid
  1.1 - Populate entries, either:
    1.1.a - click the import button. Select a text file, one line per entry.
    1.1.b - click the + button, type-in the entry text.
  1.2 - Select entries for the next game
    - Click the + button next to the entries you want to select for the next game.
  1.3 - Configure the Bingo grid
    - Configure the number of rows & columns you want for the game
    - Number of cells in the grid need to be lesser or equal to the number selected entries
    - Time to allow before and after confirmation to consider a player's tentative to be valid
    - Make sure that the number of selected items is large enough to at least fill the configured grid.
      The grid will contain red cells and an error message will be displayed if that's not the case.
  1.4 - Save the configuration
    - Click Save
  1.5 - Launch the game
    - Check that the start button is enabled, if not verify if there are any errors displayed on the configuration panel.
    - Click Start game
  
2- Play as a viewer
  - On the stream, unfold the grid by clicking the widget on the top-left corner
  - Click one of the cell and confirm your observation with the tick button
  - Observe that a countdown is now ticking, waiting for a moderator confirmation

3- Confirm as a moderator
  - On the stream, as a moderator, observe the moderation pane open when a viewer makes a tentative
  - If needed, click the moderation widget below the grid widget to unfold the moderation pane
  - Pending confirmations are displayed on top, with their countdown ticking
  - All the other entries are available for confirmation below, if viewers haven't spotted them yet

4- See the result
  - On the viewer's overlay, observe the cell either turn green or red, depending whether a moderator confirmed it
  - On the chat, if a viewer has completed a row, a column, or the full grid, a celebration will be sent from the EBS. (Note: I expect this feature will only be active once published)
  - Viewers are expected to celebrate on the chat on their own initiative as well, of course

5- Stop the game
  - Use the static configuration page or the live configuration pane to stop the game and clear it from the EBS (if not all data expires within 7 days).


# Sample entry file to import

As an example, you can save the following lines to a separate file and use the import feature on the configuration page:

Green screen is glitching.
OBS CRASH. BOOM. move along.

Full crash. Take a pancake.
