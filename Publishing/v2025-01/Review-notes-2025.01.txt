# Testing walkthrough

    1.1.b - click the + button, type-in the entry text.
    1.1.c - you can also remove or edit entries using the corresponding icons
  1.2 - Select entries for the next game
    - Click the + button next to the entries you want to select for the next game.
    - Remove entries you want to remove from the selected list, using the "-" button
  1.3 - Configure the Bingo grid
    - Configure the number of rows & columns you want for the game
    - Number of cells in the grid need to be lesser or equal to the number selected entries
    - Time to allow before and after confirmation to consider a player's tentative to be valid
    - Make sure that the number of selected items is large enough to at least fill the configured grid.
      The grid will contain red cells and an error message will be displayed if that's not the case.
  1.4 - Save the configuration
    - Click Save
  1.5 - Launch the game
    - Check that the start button is enabled, if not verify if there are any errors displayed on the configuration panel.
    - Click Start game
    - Note that the view will show a Game Log section, with the "Start" event shown
  
2- Play as a viewer
  - On the stream, unfold the grid by clicking the widget on the top-left corner
    - If prompted, allow identity sharing first to see the grid
  - If only a "Waiting to start the game" message appear, check that the game is active on the configuration panel.
  - Click one of the cell and confirm your observation with the tick button
  - Observe that a countdown is now ticking, waiting for a moderator confirmation

3- Confirm as a moderator
  - On the stream, as a moderator, observe the moderation pane open when a viewer makes a tentative
  - If needed, click the moderation widget below the grid widget to unfold the moderation pane
  - Pending confirmations are displayed on top, with their countdown ticking
  - All the other entries are available for confirmation below, if viewers haven't spotted them yet

4- See the result
  - On the viewer's overlay, observe the cell either turn gold or grey depending whether a moderator confirmed it
  - On the chat, once the confirmation grace period is over, the EBS will post a notification that the entry was confirmed
  - On the chat, if a viewer has completed a row, a column, or the full grid, a celebration will be sent from the EBS.
  - The broadcaster can also visualize these events in the Game Log on the configuration and Dashboard configuration view.
  - Viewers are expected to celebrate on the chat on their own initiative as well, of course

5 - Play as a Mobile viewer
  - On the Mobile extension panel, select entries either from the grid view or the list
  - Tap the selected entry to open the confirmation prompt
  - Tap the confirm button to confirm the entry
  - Observe that a countdown is now ticking, waiting for a moderator confirmation
  - Refer to 3 to confirm the entry using a moderator account, on a normal browser
  - Observe that the grid and list reflect whether the entry was confirmed or not

6- Stop the game
  - Use the static configuration page or the live configuration pane to stop the game and clear it from the EBS (if not all data expires within 7 days).
